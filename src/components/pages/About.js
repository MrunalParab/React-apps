                <h6>The Delhi Metro has been instrumental in ushering in a new era in the sphere of mass 
                    urban transportation in India. The swanky and modern Metro system introduced comfortable, 
                    air conditioned and eco-friendly services for the first time in India and completely 
                    revolutionized the mass transportation scenario not only in the National Capital Region but 
                    the entire country.
                    Apart from providing Delhites with a comfortable public transport option, the Delhi
                    Metro is also contributing significantly towards controlling pollution as well as 
                    reducing vehicular congestion on the roads.</h6>
